# üöÄ Deployment Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to ensure the Spotty application is fully deployable to Vercel.

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. Admin Routes Functionality
**File**: [backend/src/routes/adminRoutes.js](file:///c:/Users/vasus/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/Spotty/backend/src/routes/adminRoutes.js)

**Issue**: Delete routes for songs and albums were missing, which would cause admin functionality to be incomplete.

**Fix**: Uncommented and properly implemented the delete routes:
```javascript
router.delete("/songs/:id", deleteSong);
router.delete("/albums/:id", deleteAlbum);
```

### 2. Vercel Configuration Optimization
**Files**: 
- [vercel.json](file:///c:/Users/vasus/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/Spotty/vercel.json) (root)
- [backend/vercel.json](file:///c:/Users/vasus/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/Spotty/backend/vercel.json)

**Issue**: Potential conflicts in build configurations and missing region specification.

**Fixes**:
- Simplified root [vercel.json](file:///c:/Users/vasus/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/Spotty/vercel.json) build configuration to use specific file paths
- Added region specification to backend [vercel.json](file:///c:/Users/vasus/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/Spotty/backend/vercel.json) for consistent deployment

### 3. Documentation Improvements
**Files**:
- [DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md](file:///c:/Users/vasus/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/Spotty/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md) (new)
- [README.md](file:///c:/Users/vasus/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/Spotty/README.md) (updated)

**Improvements**:
- Created a comprehensive deployment checklist with step-by-step instructions
- Updated README to reference the new deployment checklist
- Provided clear guidance on environment variables and troubleshooting

## üß™ Verification

All modified files have been checked for syntax errors and none were found.
